# üì∏ S3 Gallery App

The **S3 Gallery App** is a full-stack application for uploading, storing, and viewing images in an **S3-compatible storage service** (like AWS S3 or MinIO).
It provides a simple UI to upload images/videos, list them, downlaod images/videos,edit image/video titles, preview images/videos, filter them and view them as a gallery.

This app is useful for projects where you want a self-hosted image gallery backed by cloud or local object storage.

* Upload images directly to S3 (AWS or MinIO).
* View uploaded images in a gallery format.
* Delete images from storage.
* Configurable for AWS S3 or local MinIO.
* Environment variable support for credentials and storage settings.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/s3-gallery-app.git
cd s3-gallery-app

```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin" \
  -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin" \
  minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

* Dashboard: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)
* Create a bucket named **`my-s3-gallery`**

### 5. Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now open **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** (or whichever port your frontend runs on).
